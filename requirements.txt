# tensorflow should be pinned to a version known to be stable with deepface and Python 3.9/3.10.
# 2.10.0 is often the last stable version before the Keras 3 transition started causing issues.
tensorflow==2.10.0 

# Pin the deepface version, as its dependencies often cause conflicts.
# The latest stable versions often fix past dependency issues.

# opencv-python-headless is necessary for deepface, but a specific, non-headless version is
# often required to work with some webcams/GUIs. Use the standard one or pin a stable version.
