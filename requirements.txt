# --- TensorFlow and Keras Compatibility ---
# NOTE: The current stable TensorFlow version is 2.16.1. 
# Version 2.20.0 does not exist yet and will cause installation failure.
# Also, tf-keras is not a package name; Keras is included in TensorFlow.
# If you must use a specific version, use a known valid one (e.g., 2.16.1).
tensorflow==2.16.1 

# NOTE: Keras is now included in TensorFlow. Installing it separately (as 'tf-keras' 
# or 'keras') is usually redundant or can cause conflicts. deepface will pull in 
# compatible dependencies.

# NOTE: Protobuf is a critical dependency. deepface/TensorFlow usually handle this.
# Specifying a version that high (5.x) may be incompatible with TensorFlow 2.16.1. 
# It's best to let TensorFlow handle the protobuf version.
# protobuf>=5.28.0 # <-- REMOVE: Let TensorFlow manage this version
